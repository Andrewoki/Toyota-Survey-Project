# Toyota-Survey-Project

My team and I used qualtrics to create a survey for Toyota users about their levels of interest in electric vehicles.
We designed the survey and created questions to help further our understanding of which groups were interested in electric vehicles and for what reasons.
After creating our survey, we distributed it out to many Toyota users and collected our data.
We used the data collected in order to make a report generalizing the reasons why people are interestid in fully electric vehicles.
